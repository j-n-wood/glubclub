# Getting Github to connect

* Firefox popup etc blocking made it hard to get/see the connection to Github work
* Connecting in Chrome worked fine
* Setting a previously manual upload project to use GH had a few problems - or maybe not?
* LLM tools suggest options that cannot be found. Could be Cloudflare updates.
* Setting output folder requires the wrangler.jsonc
* At this point the original project appears to actually be building from GH
* A second project set up with GH integration from the beginning is therefore not needed (added from scratch as expected settings like 'Framework' not seen)
* Maybe RTFM rather than chat with a bot...
